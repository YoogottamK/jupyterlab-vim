# jupyterlab-vim

This is a modified version of the [original plugin](https://github.com/jwkvam/jupyterlab-vim). The original only worked with jupyterlab v1. This should work with v3.
If you want to use v2, please checkout the v2 tag.

Changes were made as mentioned in the [extension migration guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_migration.html)

## Install
```bash
jlpm install
jlpm run build
jupyter labextension link .
```

Tested with v3.0.5
