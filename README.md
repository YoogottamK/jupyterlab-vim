# jupyterlab-vim

This is a modified version of the [original plugin](https://github.com/jwkvam/jupyterlab-vim). The original only worked with jupyterlab v1. This should work with v2.1

Changes were made as mentioned in the [extension migration guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/extension_migration.html)

## Install
```bash
jlpm install
jlpm run build
jupyter labextension link .
```

Tested with v2.1.2
